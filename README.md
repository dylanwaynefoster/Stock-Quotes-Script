Powershell script to request and print out latest stock quote for user entered symbol

I love the internet, however I am not always so fond of the Web...

I enjoy writing computer programs that run via a command line or shell script. I do not want to wade through advertisements and browser-based-bs when I want to find out the current price of "XYZ" stock. Therefore, I wrote a script for use in Powershell that accepts a stock symbol as user input, calls the IEX API, and prints a text file with the company name and the stocks latest price. 

This is enough for me, but the API has tons of information if you wanted to print other things about that particular symbol or use it in another program.

Thanks for checking it out...cheers!
